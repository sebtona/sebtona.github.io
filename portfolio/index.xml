      <description>This MATLAB project completed in my Advanved Engineering Mathematics course demonstrates how eigenvectors and eigenvalues can be used for image re-synthesis and compression. I learned the following important takeaways by completing this project:
 Any image can be represented as a set of eigenpairs (eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors).  Original Cameraman Image and Plot of Eigenvalues
   Some image eigenvalues have greater magnitudes than others.  Magnitude of Eigenvalues of Image</description>

      <title>Dancing Hexapod</title>

      <description>The inspiration for my final project in my Principles of Robotics class stemmed from Boston Dynamics&amp;rsquo; video of their dancing robots. I proposed the creation of a hexapod (six-legged) mobile robot that could accurately detect the tempo of a song or audio file being played, and perform a set of dance moves that are synchronized to the beat. As a stretch goal, I wanted the hexapod to move toward the audio source before dancing, just as a human would at a concert.</description>

      <description>This MATLAB project completed in my Advanved Engineering Mathematics course demonstrates gradient and Laplacian edge detection techniques, and their caveats with grayscale images. I learned the following important takeaways by completing this project:
 Taking the gradient of an image in any direction (by convolving the image with a kernel) will result in an intuitive visualization of how quickly pixel values change in said direction. This can be used as a crude edge detection method.</description>

      <description>For my Multidisciplinary Senior Design (MSD) project, I worked on a team to develop the sensing system for the &amp;ldquo;pediatric test mannequin&amp;rdquo;: an anthromorphic test device for a motorized pediatric stander. The motorized pediatric stander kit was developed by a previous MSD team to enable children with limited mobility to manually control their motion. This test mannequin was designed with the purpose of collecting data to characterize the stander&amp;rsquo;s performance and the rider&amp;rsquo;s experience/safety.</description>
