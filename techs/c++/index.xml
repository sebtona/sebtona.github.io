      <description>The inspiration for my final project in my Principles of Robotics class stemmed from Boston Dynamics&amp;rsquo; video of their dancing robots. I proposed the creation of a hexapod (six-legged) mobile robot that could accurately detect the tempo of a song or audio file being played, and perform a set of dance moves that are synchronized to the beat. As a stretch goal, I wanted the hexapod to move toward the audio source before dancing, just as a human would at a concert.</description>

      <description>For my Multidisciplinary Senior Design (MSD) project, I worked on a team to develop the sensing system for the &amp;ldquo;pediatric test mannequin&amp;rdquo;: an anthropomorphic test device for a motorized pediatric stander. The motorized pediatric stander kit was developed by a previous MSD team to enable children with limited mobility to manually control their motion. This test mannequin was designed with the purpose of collecting data to characterize the stander&amp;rsquo;s performance and the rider&amp;rsquo;s experience/safety.</description>
