      <title>Gesture Controlled Drone Simulation</title>

      <description>I worked in a team with two of my fellow students on a final project for our Biorobotics/Cybernetics class. The goals of the project were to create a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying a predetermined set of hand and arm gestures based on a user&amp;rsquo;s biosignals, and to use said model to control a quadcopter drone&amp;rsquo;s trajectory in a simulation environment.
We began this project by agreeing on a set of fifteen hand/arm gestures that map to commands for the drone to move and rotate along all axes in 3D space.</description>

      <title>Dancing Hexapod</title>

      <description>The inspiration for my final project in my Principles of Robotics class stemmed from Boston Dynamics&amp;rsquo; video of their dancing robots. I proposed the creation of a hexapod (six-legged) mobile robot that could accurately detect the tempo of a song or audio file being played, and perform a set of dance moves that are synchronized to the beat. As a stretch goal, I wanted the hexapod to move toward the audio source before dancing, just as a human would at a concert.</description>

      <title>Pediatric Test Mannequin</title>

      <description>For my Multidisciplinary Senior Design (MSD) project, I worked on a team to develop the sensing system for the &amp;ldquo;pediatric test mannequin&amp;rdquo;: an anthropomorphic test device for a motorized pediatric stander. The motorized pediatric stander kit was developed by a previous MSD team to enable children with limited mobility to manually control their motion. This test mannequin was designed with the purpose of collecting data to characterize the stander&amp;rsquo;s performance and the rider&amp;rsquo;s experience/safety.</description>
